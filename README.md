# katanga-run_v1.0.0
My first python project back in senior high school. Just a simple game made with the PyGame library with a scrolling background, a player and a few mobs.
You need python 2.7+ installed and PyGame.
Forgive me as this code is really old, and my first ever programming project, thus most of the code in there is "primitive" and unnecessary.
Feel free to edit this code as much as you like and send me any completed projects at akangah89@gmail.com
Currently working on a better version!
